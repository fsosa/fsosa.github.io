description:
  This Harris Country project speaks to the surveying teams' expertise in
  performing surveys for design on multiple large areas. The project involved
  the realization of survey for the design of the three (3) sections of a toll highway
  of approximately one (1) mile each, including toll road plaza facilities in each of those sections.
  <p>
  Horizontal and vertical survey controls were established on the three (3) sections
  of the route to be used for boundary and topographic surveys, aerial LIDAR surveys, and terrestrial
  LIDAR surveys on the toll road facilities.
  <p>
  The topographic survey included location of skybridges and tunnels on
  some of the plazas by using Terrestrial LIDAR equipment, and the locations
  of underground utilities as marked for Texas 811, as designated by a SUE engineering company
  on a Quality Level “A” (Test hole/Pot holing).
