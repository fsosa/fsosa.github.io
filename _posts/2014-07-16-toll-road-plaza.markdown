description:
  This Harris Country project speaks to the surveying teams' expertise in
  performing surveys for design on multiple high traffic areas. The project involved
  the realization of survey for the design of the three (3) sections of a toll highway
  being approximately one (1) mile each, including toll road plaza facilities in each of those sections.
  <p>
  Horizontal and vertical survey controls were established on the three (3) sections
  of the route to be used for boundary and topographic surveys, aerial and terrestrial
  Lidar surveys on the toll road facilities.
  <p>
  The topographic survey included location of skybridges at grade facilities and tunnels on
  some of the plazas by using terrestrial Lidar equipment, and the locations
  of underground utilities as marked by Texas 811 and as designated by a SUE engineering company
  on a Quality Level “A” (Test hole/Pot holing).
