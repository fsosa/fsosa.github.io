description: This Harris county project form part of our surveyors team expertise in
  performing surveys for design on multiple large areas. The project
  comprehended the realization of survey for design for three (3)
  sections of a Toll highway of approximately one (1) mile each and
  including a Toll road plaza facilities in each of those sections. Horizontal
  and vertical survey controls were established on the three (3) sections
  of the route, to be used for boundary and topographic surveys, Aerial
  LIDAR surveys, and Terrestrial LIDAR surveys on the Toll road facilities.
  The topographic survey included location of skybridges and tunnels on
  some of the plazas by using Terrestrial LIDAR equipment, and location
  of underground utilities as marked for Texas 811, and also as
  designated by a SUE engineering company on a Quality Level “A” (Test
