description:
  Solar Surveying was contracted to recover/establish the primary control points
  and existing and proposed right-of-way markers along a 7-mile long farm to market highway in Harris County, Texas, to perform
  boundary alignment for 45 acquisition parcels and
  to update the topographic / planimetric map to show all improvements on said parcels. The highway was adjoined by commercial tracts,
  churches, and flooded areas by waterway crossing the road.
  <p>
  Solar utilized GPS/VRS and conventional survey equipment to recover/establish controls and to
  gather boundary and topographic survey data. Solar also produced the survey control sheets
  in MicroStation DGN format and performed quality control and quality assurance for the entire project.
