description:
  Solar Surveying was contracted to recover/establish the primary control points
  and existing and proposed right-of-way markers along a 7-mile highway in Harris County, Texas.
  Additionally, the team was contracted to do the boundary alignment for 45 acquisition parcels and
  to update the topographic map for improvements on said parcels. The highway was adjoined by commercial tracts,
  churches, and flooded areas by a bayou crossing the road.
  <p>
  Solar utilized GPS/VRS and conventional equipment to recover/establish controls and to
  gather boundary and topographic survey data. Solar also produced the survey control sheets
  in DGN format and performed quality control and quality assurance for the entire project.
