  This City of Conroe project required survey team
  expertise in performing project route surveys. The main objective of this
  project was the establishment of existing right-of-way lines along a half-mile section of road and, by utilizing a proposed right-of-
  way template (schematic) provided by the city, perform boundary surveys for the acquisition of
  twelve (12) parcels. The deliverables included parcel plats and
  legal descriptions for each of the twelve parcels, which were
  prepared in full compliance with the city CADD standards, and the project
  was completed on schedule. The project is now in the construction phase.
