description:
  Solar Surveying, LLC was contracted to recover/establish the primary
  control points and existing and proposed right-of-way markers along a
  7-Mile highway in Harris County, Texas, to do the Boundary alignment
  for 45 acquisition parcels and to update the topographic map for
  improvements on said parcels. The highway was adjoined by
  commercial tracts, churches and flooded areas by a bayou crossing the
  road. Solar utilized GPS/VRS and conventional equipment for
  recover/establish controls, and for gathering boundary and topographic
  survey data. Solar also produced the survey control sheets in DGN
  format and ensured quality control and quality assurance for the
  complete project.
