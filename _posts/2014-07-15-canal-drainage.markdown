description: When areas suffer from intense and prolonged rainfall the efficiency of
  waterways and rain water reservoirs are critical to reduce the
  possibility of flooding. Our surveyors team expertise in drainage
  projects include one contracted for the San Jacinto River Authority for
  the South Canal drainage improvements. This project required
  boundary and topographic surveys for several portions of the Canal
  around different siphons, including the boundary determination of a
  mile long and a mile wide Highlands Reservoir. The topographic surveys
  include Canal levees locations, Canal cross-sections, siphons dimensions
  and depths, and underground utilities depths determination as
  designated on a SUE Quality Level “B”. The deliverables included
  electronic drawings in DWG format for the topographic and boundary
  surveys, and preparation of Cross-section profiles.
