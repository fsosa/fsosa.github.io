description:
  When areas suffer from intense and prolonged rainfall, the efficiency of waterways and
  rainwater reservoirs is critical in order to reduce the possibility of flooding.
  Our surveyors teams' expertise in drainage projects include a project contracted for the
  San Jacinto River Authority for the South Canal drainage improvements.
  <p>
  This project required boundary and topographic surveys for several portions of the
  canal around different siphons, including the boundary determination of a mile long
  and mile wide Highlands Reservoir.
  <p>
  The topographic surveys include canal levees locations, canal cross-sections, siphons dimensions
  and depths, and underground utilities depths determination as
  designated on a SUE Quality Level “B”. The deliverables included
  electronic drawings in DWG format for the topographic and boundary
  surveys, and preparation of cross-section profiles.
