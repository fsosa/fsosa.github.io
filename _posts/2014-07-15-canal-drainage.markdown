description:
  The survey team's expertise in drainage projects include a project contracted for the
  San Jacinto River Authority for the South Canal drainage improvements.
  <p>
  This project required boundary and topographic surveys for several portions of the
  canal around different siphons, including the boundary determination of a mile long
  and mile wide Highlands Reservoir.
  <p>
  The topographic surveys include canal levee locations, canal cross-sections, siphon dimensions
  and depths, and underground utilities as-built locations, as
  designated by a SUE Quality Level “B”. The deliverables included
  electronic drawings in AutoCAD DWG format for the topographic and boundary
  surveys, and preparation of cross-section profiles.
