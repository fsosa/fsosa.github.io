description:

  The Solar Surveying team performed a boundary and topographic survey on an
  approximately three (3) acre church facility. Utilizing GPS/VRS and conventional
  mapping techniques to quickly and precisely collect data allowed us to deliver
  mapping results within a quick 20-day turnaround to meet the client's schedule.
  <p>
  Work began by establishing controls and assigning them Texas Coordinate System coordinates
  using County Floodplain Reference Marks. Field crew searched for and located property corners
  for the subject tract and adjoiners and all improvements in the subject tract.
  <p>
  Once the survey data was processed, the boundary line-work was aligned,
  improvements were drawn, and a complete map for a TSPS Category 1A, Condition II,
  Land Title Survey was created. Quality assurance and quality control was performed
  on the final map. The final map was stamped and signed by an RPLS and delivered to the client on schedule.
