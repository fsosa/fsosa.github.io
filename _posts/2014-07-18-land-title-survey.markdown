description:

  The Solar Surveying team performed a boundary and limited topographic survey on an
  approximately three (3) acre church facility. Utilizing GPS/VRS and conventional
  mapping techniques to quickly and precisely collect data allowed us to deliver
  mapping results within a quick delivery to meet the client's schedule.
  <p>
  Work began by establishing controls and assigning Texas State Coordinate System, South Central Zone coordinates
  using County Floodplain Reference Marks. All supporting title documents were COGO sketched for the survey field crew to search, recover and locate property corners
  for the subject tract and adjoiners, also all improvements on the subject tract.
  <p>
  Once the survey data was processed, the boundary was constructed,
  improvements were drawn, and a complete map for a TSPS Category 1A, Condition II,
  Land Title Survey was created. Quality assurance and quality control was performed
  on the final map. The final map was stamped and signed by an RPLS and delivered to the client on schedule.
