description:
  REVISE A boundary survey on an approximately three (3) acre church facility
  was undertaken by the Solar Surveying, LLC team by utilizing GPS/VRS and
  conventional techniques to quickly and precisely collect data for
  performing this Boundary and Topographic survey and deliver the
  mapping results within a quick 20-day turnaround to meet the Clientâ€™s
  schedule.
  <p>
  We initiated by establishing controls and assigning them Texas
  Coordinate System coordinates by using County Floodplain Reference
  Marks. Field crew then searched and located property corners for the
  subject tract and adjoiners and all improvements in the subject tract.
  Once the survey data was processed, the linework for the
  boundary was aligned, all improvements were drawn, and a complete
  map for a TSPS Category 1A, Condition II, Land Title Survey was created,
  ensured Quality Assurance and Quality Control, stamped and signed by
  an RPLS and delivered to the client
